How to Negotiate Salary Effectively
Research Market Rates

Use platforms like Glassdoor, LinkedIn Salary Insights, and Levels.fyi to find out the market salary for someone with your experience (13+ years in Java, Spring Boot, and Elasticsearch).
Check salaries in the company for similar roles.
Wait for Them to Make the First Offer

Let the company mention a number first, so you don’t accidentally quote a lower salary.
Counter with Data

If their offer is below your expectations, counter with a reasonable number backed by market research.
Example: “Based on my experience and industry standards, I believe a salary in the range of X–Y would be more appropriate.”

Highlight Your Value

Emphasize how your skills and experience will bring value to the company.
Example: “Given my expertise in Java, Spring Boot, and Elasticsearch, I can contribute to scalable and high-performance systems, reducing operational overhead and improving efficiency.”
Negotiate Beyond Salary

If they can’t increase the base salary, ask for:
Performance-based bonuses
Stock options or RSUs
Signing bonuses
More paid time off
Flexible work arrangements
Be Confident but Professional

Avoid sounding desperate; instead, be firm yet polite.
Example: “I’m really excited about this opportunity, and I believe my skills align well with the role. However, I was expecting a compensation package closer to X, considering my expertise.”
Get the Final Offer in Writing

Once agreed, ensure you get a written confirmation before accepting.
