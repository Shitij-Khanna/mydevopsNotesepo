CI Setup : 
1. download from intershop, and adjust adjust build.gradle

then run:
gradlew intershopCISetupAll
Creates gradle files. (including nexus urls, actually all TODOs need to be adjusted)

2.
Creates devops folders in the parent folder specified.
Add and adjust gradle folder-init file propertoes, to add nexus urls etc. to be able to run deploy etc.
gradle folders with gradle wrappers are also created which need to be put in every deplyoment script (under devops folders)

Now run this command  from coprporate distributions folder: 

gradlew publish -PstaticVersion=3.0.0 -PSnapshotRelease=false -PrunOnCI=true -PrepoUserName=nexus_sa -PrepoUserPasswd=nexus_sa -PreleaseURL=https://nexus-intershop.bookspot.nl/nexus/content/repositories/distributions

this will ujpdate/create the distributions in nexus to tell it to use the release url ...
we give the version PstaticVersion=3.0.0 to give the distribution number.
nl-tba-3.0.0 is created in nexus for artifacts... nl-tba is picked from build.gradle.

cannot run without PreleaseURL, if we dont give this it will only run on local.

3. now the distribtuon whose path is in gradlew wwrapper is created in nexus with the above command.
Inside the D:\eserver\eci\devops\deployments\eciproject\gradle\wrapper, we have the dstribution url to which the distributuon was uploaded.

and inside "D:\eserver\eci\devops\gradle\corporate-distribution\gradle\wrapper", there is the distributionurl from where the gradle is downloaded and used to upload to nexus with the command in step 2. 


4. Then we download the responsive starter store.
copy the url from intershop  section 6.2.3 in document
change the nexus url
download the itnershop demo shop from the created url...
Extract the demo cartridges in the eciproject folder....which was created from cisetupall.

The assembly is inspired_b2c and b2x..
Use the b2x version to rename it to the name we usse.
also change in eciproject/build.gradle to rename the assembly project to the new name.
And also update all settings.gradle in all deployments with the new name of assembly.
