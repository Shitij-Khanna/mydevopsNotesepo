CLUSTER QUERY LANGUAGE:

Cluster queries are expressions that enable you to group objects.

For example, you can group container instances by attributes such as Availability Zone, instance type, or custom metadata.

Expressions have the following syntax: subject operator [argument]

Example 1: The following expression selects instances with the specified instance type.
attribute:ecs.instance-type == t2.small
attribute:ecs.instance-type == t2.small

Example 2: The following expression selects instances in the us-east-1a or us-east-1b Availability Zone.
attribute:ecs.availability-zone in [us-east-1a, us-east-1b]

AUTO SCALING
Service Auto Scaling
Amazon ECS service can optionally be configured to use Service Auto Scaling to adjust the desired task count up or down automatically.

Service Auto Scaling leverages the Application Auto Scaling service to provide this functionality.

Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling supports the following types of scaling policies:

Target Tracking Scaling Policies—Increase or decrease the number of tasks that your service runs based on a target value for a specific CloudWatch metric.
Step Scaling Policies—Increase or decrease the number of tasks that your service runs in response to CloudWatch alarms. Step scaling is based on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments, which vary based on the size of the alarm breach.
Scheduled Scaling—Increase or decrease the number of tasks that your service runs based on the date and time.
